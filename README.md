# saab_to_bmw_cluster_instrument
Sketch to be able to use a BMW E36 instrument (RPM) cluster (Only 6 cylinders engines) with a Saab Trionic 5 ECU (2.0T b204 and 2.3T b234 engines). You need an arduino, some resistors to make a voltage divider, and wires. (The output from the ECU is in 12V form here is where you need the voltage divider)
